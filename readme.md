## Installation

1. Go to the [English Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).
2. Click on 'New Boost' in the corresponding Arc menu.
3. Click 'Custom' and 'A specific website' and 'Create Boost'.
4. Copy and paste all the file contents from `boost-template` into the corresponding files using the Arc editor.
5. Click on the options icon (top left in the boost editor status bar), and 'Open in Finder'.
6. Open the `manifest.json` file from the Finder folder in a text editor (it's important that you don't delete or replace it, otherwise Arc gets a bit confused.)
7. Copy the contents of `manifest.json` from `boost-template` into that file, and safe it.
8. Restart Arc to apply the manifest changes, and you're good to go, enjoy!
